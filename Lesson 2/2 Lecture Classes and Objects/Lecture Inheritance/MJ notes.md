Classes don't define instance variables, they define attributes.
Instance variables don't exist prior to an object being created and value being assigned to them.

**DINSTINCTION B/W ATTRIBUTES & INSTANCE VARIABLES**

`@instance_variable` as an instance variable within the context of its belonging to a particular object.

`@instance_variable` as an *attribute signifier* within the context of a class definition.


"Within our `<insert class name>` class definition, the presence of `@name`  attribute signifier will predetermine the existence of `@name` instance variable inhering to every object of the `<insert class name>` class."

The two contingent properties of attributes are both behaviours.
Getter methods, Setter methods.


**Encapsulation**
Is a form of data protection that allows programmers to hide functionality form the rest of the code base.

"OOP gives programmers the flexibility to encapsulate state within the object, allowing them to predetermine the accessibility of instance variables."


The state is keeping track of all the attributes defined within the class.


State tracks attributes for the objects, instance variables keep track of an object's state.


**NOTES**

1. Classes define an essence for objects, consisting of attributes and behaviours.

2. Objects are instantiated from classes and are predetermined by the class definition.

3. An object's state tracks the attributes of the class, an object's instance variables keep track of its state.

4. Class behaviours predetermine the instance methods accessible to every particular object of the class.

5. Class attributes predetermine the instance variables pertaining to every particular object of the class.

6. Attributes may posses two continget behavioural properties, and the contingency of these two properties is a precondition for encapsulation.
