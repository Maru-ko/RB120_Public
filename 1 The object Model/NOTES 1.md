`methods` and `blocks` are not objects.

'hello'.class <=# instance method


class GoodDog
end

#OBJECT
sparky = GoodDog.new <- instance of a good dog class
**we created an instance of our GoodDog class and stored it in var `sparky`
we now have an object**
p sparky.class `GoodDog`

Sparky is an `instance` or `object` of `GoodDog` class.

Creating a NEW OBJECT or INSTANCE from a class is called **INSTANTIATION**
We instantiated an object called sparky form the class GoodDog.

\#.new is a **class method**

This whole process is called **`INSTANTIATION`**
