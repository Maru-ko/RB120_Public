We use `Classes` to create `Objects`
***states & behaviours***
Two things we focus on when defining classes.

**States** track *atributes* for individual objects.
**Behaviors** are what objects are capable of doing.

`Instace Variables` are scoped at the **object** or **instance** level, and how objects keep track of their states.

`Instance methods` defined in a class ar availalbe to objects(instances) of that class.


`Instance Variables` keep track of *state*
`Instance Methods` expose *behavior* for objects.

`new` is a class method
`initialize` is an instance method
`initialize` methid is a ***constructor*** because it gets triggered whenver we create a new object.


___
focus on how a string is passed from the new method to the constructor as a local variable, ultimately assigning the string to an instance method.
instance variables is how we keep track
